### Suppliers
<!-- Build and/or supply the hardware, software, or infrastructure on which the system will run -->

Since Phaser is a framework for JavaScript browser games, the users have to supply a website where a browser can load the framework.

More important suppliers however are the dependencies of the sofware.
Of course JavaScript is the most important one in that.
All the rendering is handled by either WebGL or an HTML5 Canvas.

Node.js is the supplier of the webpack buildsystem.
