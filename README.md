Usage
=====

Exported logos
==============
For easy use, the different versions of the logo are released in different file formats.
The possible combinations are:
* Color - Black
* Text - NoText
* *.pdf, *.eps, *.png
* Small, Medium and Large resolutions.

A vector version (*.tikz, *.pdf, *.eps) of the logo should be used where possible.

Installation & Dependencies
===========================
Compiling the logo requires LaTeX.

ImageMagick is used to convert the pdfs to other formats.

Ubuntu
------

```sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra```
